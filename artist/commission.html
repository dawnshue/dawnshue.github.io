I have the right to post any commissioned artwork on deviantart or my website. You may discuss with me if you wish for me to postpone publicizing the artwork to a certain date.
Please be patient about the length of time required to complete the commission. Feel free to discuss approximate timeframes with me if necessary.
You will receive the full resolution illustration, which is typically at least 3000x3000 pixels. Feel free to request a specific canvas size upon commissioning.
I am open to suggestions on the composition, etc., however be advised that as the artist, I have the artistic license to proceed with the art as I am comfortable.

Updated 01/14/15: Prices modified to better account for time spent on work. Traditional-related items are still unavailable unless you're fine with photographed sketches, feel free to inquire. :)

Terminology:
SIMPLE CREATURE = a small and/or simple animal, monster, or familiar, etc., such as a cat, simple pokemon, etc. Features like jewelry, scales, horns and detailed wings will constitute as a complex Creatures.

COMPLEX CREATURE = complex and/or large creature, may count as an additional character depending on complexity (especially for CG artwork). Complex creatures tend to have distinct and intricate features such as jewelry, noticeable teeth, horns, scales, feathers, etc.

CHARACTER REFERENCE SHEET = usually entails 3 angles of headshots, 3 angles of fullbody views, and any additional details you want to draw attention to. You may request more fullbodies such as to show different layers of clothing, etc. as an added percent of the cost. Only one character per reference sheet.
